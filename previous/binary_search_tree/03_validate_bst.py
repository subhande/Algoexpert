# Validate BST

"""
Write a function that takes in a potentially invalid Binary Search Tree (BST) and returns a boolean representing whether the BST is valid. 

Each BST node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node. A node is said to be a valid BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property: its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid BST nodes themselves or None / null.

A BST is valid if and only if all of its nodes are valid BST nodes.

Sample Input

tree =              10
                  /    \
                 5      15
                / \    /  \
               2   5  13  22
              /        \
             1          14

Sample Output
true
